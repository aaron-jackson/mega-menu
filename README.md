# Simple Bootstrap Mega Menu

This is a simple bootstrap mega menu. As of now it is built using Bootstrap 5 features. This does not use JS which is pretty cool if you ask me. I got this idea from a few blog posts that I read. Feel free to fork, favorite or book mark this for future use! I know I will :)
